我们正在推出一项有趣的迷你项目—“四张椅子项目”。灵感来源于MIT的雪莉·特尔克博士的颇具影响力的著作《重拾对话》。通过这个项目，我们期待与来自不同领域的研究者和学者展开跨学科对话。在通用人工智能（AGI）时代的临界点，我们生成知识的方式亟需根本性变革。因此，我们必须勇敢地跳出熟悉知识领域的舒适区。四张椅子项目旨在集众人之力，拥抱无拘无束的想象力，引领我们走向创新和变革的思维之路。

我们中心位于美丽的上海交通大学（SJTU）校园内。更值得一提的是，我们的中心周围环绕着几家不错的咖啡馆。欢迎你来与我们一边品味香浓的咖啡，一边畅谈交流。你也可以通过电子邮箱yimou@sjtu.edu.cn或推特（X）上的@yimou，联系我们的创始主任牟怡博士。

We are experimenting an exciting mini-project called "The Four Chairs Project," which is inspired by Dr. Sherry Turkle's influential book, Reclaiming Conversation. Through this initiative, we aspire to foster cross-disciplinary dialogues with researchers and scholars from diverse fields. As we stand at the cusp of the age of artificial general intelligence (AGI), the way we generate knowledge necessitates profound transformation. Therefore, it is imperative for us to venture beyond the confines of our familiar knowledge domains. The Four Chairs Project aims to foster a collective effort in embracing unrestrained imagination, driving us towards innovative and transformative thinking.

Our center is located at the beautiful campus of Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). You can find us in the map below. What’s more intriguing is our center is surrounded by a handful of nice cafes. Welcome to talk to us over delicious coffee. Or you can reach the founding director, Dr. Yi Mou, virtually at yimou@sjtu.edu.cn or @yimou on Twitter (X).
