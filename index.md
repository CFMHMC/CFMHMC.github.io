# Our Mission

The Center for Future Media & Human-Machine Communication (CFMHMC) was founded in 2018 by a group of curious researchers to seek to answer the following questions:

How do humans interact with technologies, especially artificial intelligence (AI), on their daily basis?
What are the psychological and behavioral effects of interacting with intelligent machines?
How do human-machine communication fundamentally transform people as a species and society?
How can we build a better world (or at least not a worse world) with AI?

This answer-seeking journey defines our mission. On this site, you will find shorter and condenser version of it. Enjoy!
